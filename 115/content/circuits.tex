$n = N/V = e^- \text{density}$\\
$V_\text{drift} = \frac{I}{nAe}$ where $e = 1.6\times 10^{-19}C$\\
Resistivity $[\rho] = \Omega m$\\
$R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$\\
$P = IV = I^2R = \frac{V^2}{R}$
Node: sum of currents into a node = sum out.\\
Junction: algebraic sum of potential differences around a loop = 0.\\
