\subsubsection*{Capacitors}
$C = \frac{Q}{V}$\\
Capacitance depends only on geometry of conductor\\
Parallel plate: $C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}$\\
Dielectrics weaken field by factor $\kappa$ (on $\varepsilon_0$), increase
cap. by same factor.\\
In circuits, potential change across cap. $V = \frac{Q}{C}$
\subsubsection*{Energy in a capactior}
$U_C = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 = \frac{1}{2}QV = \frac{1}{2}\frac{Q}{C}^2$
\subsubsection*{Dielectric Effects}
Battery Connected (constant $V$):\\
$C' = \kappa C_0$\\
$Q' = C'V = \kappa Q_0$\\
$U' = \frac{1}{2}C'V^2 = \kappa U_0$\\
Battery Disconnected (constant $Q$): \\
$V' = \frac{Q}{C'} = \frac{V_0}{\kappa}$\\
$U' = \frac{Q^2}{2C'} = \frac{U_0}{\kappa}$
